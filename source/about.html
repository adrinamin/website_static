        <h3>Hi, I'm Adrin</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a software engineer and technology enthusiast. I'm passionate about technology which excites people up and moves society forward. So that in the end, everybody can benefit from new technologies.<br><br>
            I usually write a lot of code in all kind of languages and I try to learn as much as possible. But the truth is, I can not remember everything. So I'm using this space for all the stuff that might be useful someday. I see it as some kind of library. You can see it as some kind of premium level brain dump &#128513;. Of course, I want to share these great insights with you and I hope, you'll find it somewhat useful &#128512;.
