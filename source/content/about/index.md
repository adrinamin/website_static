Hi, I'm Adrin,
</br>
</br>
I'm an athlete and technology enthusiast. These two things are an integral part of my life which I enjoy a lot. Getting better as an athlete, and as a programmer, are pretty similar processes, as it consists of constant learning, failing and growing. This is the reason why I created this web page (it is not really a blog tbh). I see it as a space where I can document all these ups and downs. 
</br>
Being a Software Engineer and an amateur athlete means my time is very limited. But If I have time, I try to write down my thoughts to somthing related to those two fields. Maybe, there is something for you?
