Hi, I'm Adrin,
</br>
</br>
I'm a technology enthusiast and software developer.
</br></br>
I deeply care about the role of technology in our society. I always try to find ways to use our craft and tools to improve our environment, and eventually peoples lifes. So that in the end, everybody can benefit from new technologies.</br></br>
I never stop learning and I always try apply my new skills to solve real world problems. Thus I'm not bound to any particular framework or programming language.
</br></br>
Because, it is often difficult to remember and recall all the things that I've learnt over time, I want to use this place to have a library to come back and check my notes. Maybe there is something useful for you as well.
