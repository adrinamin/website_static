# Hello Folks!
### My name is Adrin and welcome to my library of all the stuff, I might need in the future. I try to sort everything as good as possible. Maybe, there is something useful for you, as well.  

### Everything is programming and computer science related. I'm not bound to any language or framework. So you will find here different reads about different dev topics.
