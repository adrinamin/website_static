## Hello Folks!

#### My name is Adrin and welcome to my collection of notes and articles. I try to sort everything as good as possible. Maybe, there is something useful for you, as well &#128516;.  

#### Everything is programming and computer science related. I'm not bound to any language or framework. I currently work a lot with C#, dotnet and cloud computing. But I also do some side projects in Python and sometimes I code in C++. 

#### So you will find here different reads about different dev topics.
