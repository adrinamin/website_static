# How tech brought improved my fitness level

Last year, in January, I decided to start competing again in sports. I've played football (soccer) for 12 years in my youth. It was a lot of fun and it taught me to be resilient and how to come back from defeat. Along the way, you make a lot of friends and you grow as a team. 

But at some point I realized that becoming a pro player was out of reach. So I decided to go to college to get an actual job :D. After studying and launching my career, I realized that something was missing. It is very important for me to stay fit and healthy but I always thought that time is probably a limiting factor. That is why I just went to the gym to keep my body in shape.

Traning for races requires a lot of effort but it is possible for everyone. Last year, in January, my cousin introduced me to a type of fitness racing, called Hyrox. I immediately fell in love with that sport and I started to compete in races.

Hyrox races are very demanding, so you need to be very clever with your energy and how much you want to push during the race. Dong that blindly can be dangerous and without any preparation those races can be hell.

So the question is how can you be the most efficient and use tech for preparation and for the races themselves?
