As a software engineers, we probably spend a lot of time sitting in front of a computer, which can affect our physical and mental health. That's why engaging in sports, and physical activity is essential for us and our overall health. It can clear your mind and relieve stress.

## Why am I writing this post?

This is just the start of a new series. I want to show devs how we can mix our tech skills to improve our overall health. Because sitting around all day will decrease our health over time. But our brain and body is deeply connected and we need a healthy body to have a healthy brain which ultimately let us perform at the highest level.

## What will I write about?

As a fitness enthusiast, I'm always looking for ways to improve my performance and reach my goals at work and during fitnes races (more on that in another post). 

In recent years, technology has played an increasingly important role in this quest, providing a wealth of tools and resources to help me take my fitness to the next level.

I will write about what can lift us to the next level. What technologies and tools we can use daily make us healther. What dev tools we could use to build things that make us healthier. And what it takes to make it a habit. 

## Why is this even useful?

Technology has made it easier to stay motivated. On the track, from wearable fitness trackers that monitor my heart rate, steps taken, and calories burned, to workout apps that provide personalized training programs and track my progress.

One of the most significant benefits of technology in fitness is the ability to access a health data and resources at your fingertips. So I can track my improvements and make changes over time.

Another advantage is the ability to set and track personal goals. With wearable technology and workout apps, I can set specific goals for myself, such as running a certain distance and tracking my progress along the way. This helps me stay motivated and focused on what I want to achieve. Not only on my fitness journey, but also on my career growth.

## Get away from your screen!

Finally, technology has also made connecting with other fitness enthusiasts and forming a supportive community easier. With social media and workout apps, I can share my progress, connect with others who share my interests and find new workout partners. And through fitness racing events, I can connect to even more people.

## Pushing it to the next level!

Overall, technology has been a game-changer for my fitness journey. Whether I'm looking for inspiration, information, or motivation, a tool or resource is available to help me reach my goals. If you want to take your fitness to the next level, embrace technology as a valuable tool in your arsenal.
