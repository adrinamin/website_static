If you are like me, you probably write a lot of tests for your production code. Tests verify our business logic and make us confident that our code is still correct after making changes. But what if I told you that this leads to many problems in the long term? Of course, we don't want to avoid writing code tests, but we often have an issue called Structural Coupling.

Structural coupling makes refactoring our code very difficult, and it costs us a lot of time and money! But there is one solution: a Testing API. It's an API with superpowers that helps you to get rid of this structural coupling. At the same time, you are still able to verify your business rules. So a Testing API does save you not only time but also money! That's why today I want to answer the following questions:

* What is a Testing API?
* What are the Advantages and Drawbacks of a Testing API?
* Why should you consider it?

This article will be part 1 of a series for analyzing the Testing API. Check out the full post at [codequality.rocks](https://www.codequality.rocks/post/testing-api)!
