In my [first post about the basics of the Testing API](https://www.codequality.rocks/post/testing-api), I talked about how a Testing API can help you decrease the structural coupling between your production code and your test code. In the long run, it will save you much time! A bold claim, of course, and it sounds very theoretical. To provide you with more depth than just a basic concept, I want to show you today how you can implement a Testing API with .NET. Therefore I want to look at the following aspects in more detail today:

    How to Integrate the Testing API into a given architecture?
    How to implement the Testing API with .NET?
    How to structure your Test project?

If you need more information about the basics of a Testing API and what it's good for, check out my [first post of this series](https://www.codequality.rocks/post/testing-api)!
