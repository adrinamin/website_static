Whether cloud or on-premise, you usually use a dedicated compute instance to run your server when providing public APIs. But provisioning dedicated compute instances, e.g., on Azure, is costly. Besides the basic running costs, the more traffic your API generates, the more additional costs it generates. 

The question is: Can we provide public REST-style APIs and with high performance and at the same time reducing our monthly costs? 

Here is where cloud functions come into play. These are small pieces of code that can be deployed independently and only pay for your Function when running.

For that, I want to look at:

* What are functions
* What are the Azure Functions service
* What is REST
* Why is it beneficial to create REST APIs with cloud functions
* How to implement the REST API in Azure Functions
* How can you test those API functions
